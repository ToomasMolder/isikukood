NB! Might be buggy and crappy, written for own purposes  
NB! Global configuration signature is not checked. Use this program at your own risk.  

TODO: better logic of input from user  
TODO: rewrite similarities algorithm to find possible wrong keypresses on keyboard  
TODO: sort and collect similarities to avoid duplicate similarities found
